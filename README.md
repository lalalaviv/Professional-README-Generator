# Professional README Generator

## Description

A key component of your project is a profressional README file, as it acts like a virtual storefront to a repository. 
A good README file should include essential information about the repo's project, explaining what the application is and why the technologies in it was used. The quailty of a README file can differentiate a high-quailty project from the a low qulity one. 
Although there is no one right way to structure a README file, there is one very wrong way, and that is to not have a README file at all. 
<br/>
With this README generator, there is no longer the need to create a professional README from scratch. 
By answering a few questions on the command-line, this application is able to dynamically generate a professional README.md file with the information the user provides.
